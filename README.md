# kennith.github.io

This is my home page.

## Stack

This site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). 

## About me

It's listed [here](https://kennith.github.io/about/).

## What is being blogged

Anything programming related. It's mostly what I learn from work that I thought was good to share with the rest of the world. Some of these stuff you might already know, but it's new to me and it could be new to someone too. 

## Can I contribute?

No. It is because it is not your thought, it's my thought. However, you can fork the design, if the design is anything interesting to you.
