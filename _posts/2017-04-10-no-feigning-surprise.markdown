When I started going to tech conferences and talking to other people during the breaks, most of time, I get a strange look and a typical answer of "You don't know x?".

I thought going to conference is to learn about something you don't know. 

It is discouraging to get this type of response and the comic strip below summarize my feeling, but we can change it and I can start with me. 

If you bumped into me in a conference and if you ask me something that I know, I will definitely help you. In return, I just ask you to do the same thing when someone asks you a tech questions, be excited to explain.
