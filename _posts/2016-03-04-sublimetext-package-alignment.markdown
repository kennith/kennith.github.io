## Making code easier to read 
* [Alignment](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Alignment)

Sometimes, it is hard to read when the code is like this:

```javascript
var length = 1.2;
var widthIntheFunBox = 3.0;
var depthOfBox = 9.2;
```

It is easier if the equal(=) signs are all aligned together:

```javascript
var length           = 1.2;
var widthIntheFunBox = 3.0;
var depthOfBox       = 9.2;
```

If you don't want to destroy the space key on your keyboard, with alignment, you can highlight the lines you want to align, then press ctrl+alt+a, the equal lines are now all align.
