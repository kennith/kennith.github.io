title: Participate Open Source Software

> Reading without writing is idle. 

I use a lot of open source software for work and personal projects. I think it is time for me and my team to contribute back to the open source community. 

It could be participate in discussion forum, writing documentation, or to contribute code. 

It is not something that the business world understand, but the programmers themselves.
