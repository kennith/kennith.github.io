BrowserSync is such an important assist tool for web development. In order to speed things up, I sometimes turn on the offline flag. It is because I don't need other computer to access my app in development, so I set the online flag to false.

```
online: false
```

If you are testing your app's appearance on desktop and mobile without using devtool and on physical device, you will need to turn the online flag back to true.
