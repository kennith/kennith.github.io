I am trying out the [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) blog framework today and it was not as smooth as I expected. 

I did work with the other static site generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), before. I thought since I am generating another static site, why not try another different site generator?

I was ready for the learning curve and I was ready for the unfamiliarity. However, it caught me by surprise on many fronts.

First, I did the ```npm install -g hexo-cli``` as everyone would. I ran the ```hexo init ``` to the exisiting directry of a cloned repository. Maybe my workflow was wrong, Hexo remove my .git stuff. It's no big deal, I just clone it again into another folder and copy the contents generated by hexo over. 

Second, I started the site by using ```hexo server```. No problem, but then I need to modify the theme and I did not want to destroy my F5 key, so I ran the site by using ```hexo generate --watch```, hoping that Hexo server will refresh the site automatically. Well, it turn out it was not what I was hoping it would be. No big deal, again, just ran [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io) and it will do the trick. 

What turned me off completely from Hexo is the theme syntax. It is using [EJS](http://ejs.co). Once I started to modify the files in the default theme folder, I went to the weak way, I gave up. Even with the syntax highlighting, it is just way too confusing to me. It looks like the old ASP syntax.

This is where I stopped. 

I am pretty sure if I was going to use the themes created by other people, I will continue to use Hexo. I really like it's simple Markdown syntax for post and configuration. In this case I needed to create my own theme, I guess Haxo is not for this project. 

I will certainly use Haxo for other projects that has less requirement on updating theme.
