If you ever want to find out what is going on in the background while using Sublime Text, this command will display everything in the Sublime Text Console (Ctrl+`)

```bash
sublime.log_commands(True)
```

This command is very helpful if you want to add a keyboard shortcut to the command in Sublime Text.
